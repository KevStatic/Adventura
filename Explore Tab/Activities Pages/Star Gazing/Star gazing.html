                    From Leh, you need to pass through the Changla Pass and then through Tangste. Regular buses by the state road transport corporation are also 
                    available. In addition to this, you can hire taxis, motorbikes, jeeps and cars are reasonable prices as well. Make sure you have enough fuel in
                    your vehicle as there are no petrol pumps in Pangong. The road journey from Leh to Pangong is thrilling in itself. Since the drive is tiring 
                    (though breath-taking), it is advised to avoid making the return journey the same day. </p>
